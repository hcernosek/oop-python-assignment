# Python Grades Assignment

Short OOP exercise using a `Student` class to practice lists, tuples, sets,
dictionaries, and basic regex validation.


## What It Does
- Defines a `Student` class with grade management and display helpers.
- Creates multiple student objects and adds grades.
- Looks up students by email using a dictionary.
- Collects unique grades with a set.
- Demonstrates tuple immutability with a try/except.
- Performs list operations (`pop`, first/last access, `len`).
- Bonus: validates emails and counts grades above 90.
